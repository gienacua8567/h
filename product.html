It adds its own distinct flavor and excitement to food. In some recipes, omitting or using spices can make or break the “dish”. Most food recipes naturally rely on spices to bring out their taste and unique character. In other cases, food recipes that don’t necessarily use spices can bring an exciting new twist to it when spices are added.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What is spice?  Often, the spice is used interchangeably with herbs. But there is, in fact, a big difference between them. While both generally come from plants, which part of the plant it came from makes the difference. Herbs are the leaf part of the plant it came from while spices are the rest of the parts of it. That is the bark, twig, branch, root, seed, and so on. It is used or consumed dried and mostly in powder form.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Another misconception of spices is that it equates to being hot in taste (chili hot). In most processed food products we often see that they almost always use the word “spicy” to mean that the taste is chili hot. This is not to say that chili is not a spice. In fact, it is one of the more common and popular spices among the many kinds there are. But being hot in taste isn’t all about spices. The flavor and aroma it adds to the food bring sweetness and other tastes that make food more palatable, interesting, and exciting.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Spices are almost in all of our cooking. It is not limited to the ones that we see packed or bottled in the grocery store. Some of us may not realize it but if you are used to cooking Asian cuisine or simply used to sauteing as part of your cooking then you may have been using spices al this time.  Ingredients you use to make the saute are usually garlic, onion, and ginger. These are all common spices. Other popular spices are Peppercorn, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cumin, Curry, and Paprika.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Other than giving unique flavor and excitement to food, spices also do offer some nutritional and health benefits. Most spices are known to have antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are substances that help protect the cells in our body against free radicals that are usually the cause of some types of cancer, heart disease, and other so-called “lifestyle diseases”. In some, they showed properties that are anti-inflammatory. So it helps our body fight against microbes, bacteria, viruses that can infect our bodies. Still, others promote helping the fat-burning process in our body. A lot of other benefits can be derived from spices but we’d like to point out that it can outright cure ant disease. But it does help significantly in preventing them when taken regularly. So the next time you prepare your food, if you have not done it or tried it yet, put some spice into it.
